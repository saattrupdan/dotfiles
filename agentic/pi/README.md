# pi

Personal pi-coding-agent configuration: settings, prompts, subagents, and a
suite of custom extensions that shape how the agent reads code, searches the
repo, browses the web, and delegates work to subagents.

This directory mirrors the layout expected by pi:

```
agentic/pi/
├── settings.json      pi settings (model, extensions, tool wiring)
├── SYSTEM.md          system prompt prepended to every session
├── prompts/           reusable user prompts
├── agents/            subagent definitions (markdown + frontmatter)
└── extensions/        custom tool/behavior extensions (this README)
```

## Extensions

Each subdirectory under `extensions/` is a self-contained pi extension. They
fall into three categories:

- **Tools the agent calls** — `read`, `search`, `code-tree`, `web-fetch`,
  `web-search`, `web-browse`, `subagent`.
- **Behavioural guardrails** (no tools registered) — `orchestrator-lockdown`,
  `no-repeat`.
- **Shared internal library** — `_outliner` (consumed by `read` and `search`).

### `read`

Index-backed file reader with no pagination. Three modes:

1. Small file, no symbol → returned verbatim.
2. Large file, no symbol → outline (module doc + one line per symbol with
   signature and doc-first-line).
3. `symbol` set → body of that symbol via `line_start..line_end` from the
   shared index. Supports `Class.method`.

Outline + symbol ranges come from the SQLite index in
`~/.pi/index/<repo-id>/index.db` (shared with `search`). The target file is
incrementally refreshed on every call so edits are picked up without a full
rebuild. Includes a per-session dedupe cache and a MIME sniff that surfaces
images as image content rather than raw bytes.

### `search`

Per-repo indexed search tool. Builds a SQLite index with a file manifest plus
tree-sitter symbol extraction, then merges definition-first results from
SQLite with ripgrep full-text references. Exact symbol matches are promoted
to the top. The index refreshes incrementally on every call.

`gc.ts` handles index garbage collection; `index-store.ts` is the storage
layer reused by `read`.

### `code-tree`

Directory tree of the repo (or a subdirectory). Token-efficient defaults:
directories only, depth-limited (default 2, max 6), with recursive file
counts per directory. The agent probes deeper by passing `path` and/or
`depth` explicitly. Uses `git ls-files` as the source of truth so
`.gitignore` is honoured automatically; falls back to a filesystem walk
outside a git repo.

### `web-fetch`

Fetches an HTTP(S) URL and collapses it into the smallest useful text form.
HTML is stripped to readable text (scripts, styles, nav boilerplate, SVG,
head, comments removed), entities decoded, whitespace collapsed. Non-HTML
responses (JSON, plain text) are returned as-is. Hard cap on output size;
`max_chars` overrides up to 100k. A `raw: true` flag returns the
unprocessed body.

### `web-search`

DuckDuckGo HTML-endpoint search. Returns the top results (title, URL,
snippet) as a compact Markdown list. Access-controlled: only agents whose
frontmatter lists `web_search` in `tools:` see it (in this config, the
`web-explorer` subagent). The orchestrator cannot call it because
`orchestrator-lockdown` blocks everything except `subagent` and `question`.

### `web-browse`

Thin wrapper around the `agent-browser` CLI. Takes a single command string
(e.g. `open https://example.com`, `click @ref-2`, `type input.search hello`)
and returns its stdout/stderr. Session state is preserved across calls by
`agent-browser` itself, so multi-step exploration works as a sequence of
`web_browse` calls.

### `subagent`

Delegates tasks to specialised subagents with isolated context. Modes:

- **single** — one task to one agent.
- **parallel** — `tasks: [...]` runs multiple subagents concurrently.
- **chain** — `chain: [...]` with `{previous}` placeholder threads output
  between steps.

Agents are discovered from `~/.pi/agent/agents/*.md` (user scope) and, when
`agentScope` is `project` or `both`, from `<repo>/.pi/agents/*.md`. Agent
frontmatter declares `tools`, `model`, optional `worktree: true` (run in a
fresh git worktree, merged back on exit), and an optional `skills:`
allow-list which scopes the child's `<available_skills>` block. Per-call
`skills: [...]` arrays at the top level, per task, or per chain step
union-merge with the agent's frontmatter list.

See `extensions/subagent/README.md` for the full frontmatter and
skill-scoping semantics.

### `orchestrator-lockdown`

The main agent is a pure orchestrator with no permissions of its own —
only `subagent` and the user-facing `question` tool. This extension:

1. Strips every other tool from the provider request payload before send,
   so the LLM does not even see the tools it cannot use (token-efficient).
2. As a belt-and-braces measure, also blocks any non-allowed tool call at
   the `tool_call` boundary.

Subagent child processes set `PI_SUBAGENT_CHILD=1` and opt out of both
mechanisms — they need full access to their declared tools.

### `no-repeat`

Blocks consecutive duplicate tool calls. If the agent calls the same tool
with the same arguments twice in a row, the second call is blocked with a
short nudge telling it to do something different. Catches the common "loop
forever on the same failing call" failure mode and saves tokens. Runs in
both the orchestrator and each subagent process (per-process state).
"Consecutive" means: not separated by any other tool call.

### `_outliner` (library, not a tool)

Shared tree-sitter outliner consumed by `read` and `search`. Registers no
tools. Given a file path and contents, `outline()` returns a list of
structural entries (classes, functions, methods, headings, blocks);
`collapsedView()` renders them as an indented listing that fits a
caller-specified line budget, collapsing the largest classes first when
over budget.

Supported languages: Python, TypeScript (`.ts`/`.tsx`), JavaScript
(`.js`/`.jsx`/`.mjs`/`.cjs`), Vue single-file components, Markdown
headings. Unknown extensions fall back to a heuristic blank-line splitter.
Docstrings (Python triple-quoted, JS/TS `/** */`) are extracted as the
first non-empty line, capped at 80 chars.

See `extensions/_outliner/README.md` for the public API, language table,
and collapsed-view format.
